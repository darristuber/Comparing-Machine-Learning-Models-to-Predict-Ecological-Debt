# Comparing-Machine-Learning-Models-to-Predict-Ecological-Debt
Many countries overuse naturally provided resources and are deemed ecological debtors.  We predicted creditor/debtor class using three classification models: logistic regression, decision trees, and random forest to determine which model was the most effective.

Extended Project Description: 

In the modern age of consumption and intensive resource use, it is important to look introspectively at human behaviors over time. In this project, we implemented a data analytical process to indicate the degree to which natural resources are overused. Based on their ecological footprint (EF) and biocapacity with an extensive set of related defining characteristics, countries that overuse their resources are deemed ecological debtors, while those that underuse them are ecological creditors. We predicted creditor/debtor class using three classification models: logistic regression, decision trees, and random forest. Through our comparison, we deemed the random forest model to produce higher accuracy and f1-score values than the other two models. The resultant model is advantageous to use when evaluating the future environmental footprint of all countries throughout the world.
